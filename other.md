**ideas**

* Sopranos Watch - probably just consists of our netflix party transcripts and maybe someone can write up a review, james gandolfini appreciation post, 
* Doughs and Dunks - Bilal and Dee finally make their blog rating foods as basketball players come true
* Fantasy Basketball Updates - current standings
* Best Hits - just an archive of our favorite WeDim moments, quotes, and outside content
* Monthly Newsletter - self-explanatory
* Thomas' Data Dive - all of Thomas' groupchat analytics
* Thomas' Riddler - Thomas sending an infuriating riddle that only he will get
* Art Gallery - Scraping up photos from the past but also any future Skribbl masterpieces

Maybe we just make a really crappy version of the Ringer?????
